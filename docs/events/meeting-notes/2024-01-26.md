# SIG/AltArch meeting 2024-01-26

## Attendees

* Neil Hanlon
* Bryan (codedude)
* Sherif Nagy

## Follow Ups

* Jan 2024 Uboot - Sherif completed, published 18 Jan
* RPI5 - Not going great
  * Fedora can't boot it either, and it's not upstream yet
  * Kernel is still missing Pi5 DTB
  * Armbian is working, but they're probably patching the DTB
  * Skip was working on firmware, not sure of status
  * Bryan has a working Kernel, but it's hacky and broken... but it works (nominally)
* SBC Testing
  * Testing of new Uboot underway
  * Libre Tritium H5 - works fine
  * Libre Le Potato - _appears_ that Libre hasn't upstreamed their entire uboot
    * 2024 uboot, lots of NIC resets; vendor firmware doesn't do this
      * Fedora “recommends” using vendor uboot for Potato
    * **Q**: Do we want to recommend Le Potato but with Vendor Uboot for now?
  * Rock5B/OrangePi uboot patches - not actually working right
    * thefossguy built a one-off uboot for the OrangePi using an upstream tool (which is possibly proprietary/non-free)
